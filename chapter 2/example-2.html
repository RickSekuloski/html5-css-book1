                <li>DEVELOP TECHNICAL SKILLS: despite the real advantages that come with an organized education, web development is still a field in which concrete skills can trump education when it comes to employment opportunities.</li>
                <li>PRACTICE YOUR CODING SKILLS: Web developers learn by doing. Set up a Github account and push code to the site. </li>

                <li>WEB DEVELOPMENT CERTIFICATES: he certificate option is designed for targeted educational training and is intended for students who need practical and fundamental knowledge relating to web development. </li>
